# MagicMirror Configuration

This repository contains the config for my MagicMirror configuration. I have the Mirror running on RaspbianOS using Rasoberry Pi 3+. The Pi is connected to a 23" TV screen that has been disassembled from the casing to expose only the screen. 

As seen in this image, my camera picks up on the screen although in the dark the image is super clear and no light shines through.

I've setup information in key locations that don't obstruct the view so it can still function as a mirror. I have it also set to display what music I am playing when my Bose speaker is powered on.

Feel free to download my configuration file and play around with it, you will need an API Key for the weather module which can be obtained easily at https://openweathermap.org/
